Exploratory analysis and sales forecasting for a German drugstore chain

This project was mainly concerned with the prediction of sales for different stores in the retail industry. The task involved the analysis of store-related factors and historical sales data collected from a large drug store chain in Germany. We were tasked with predicting 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 drug stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enabled store managers to increase the overall productivity and profitability of the retail business and improve their customer satisfaction. Exploratory data analysis of the historical sales data was performed in Python and SAS Enterprise Guide. A range of predictive modelling techniques were explored during the process. Namely, a series of neural network models, decision tree-based algorithms and ensemble machine learning algorithms (Random Forest Regression, XGBoost) were evaluated on Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), achieving an accuracy of 93%.
